# General Rules

- ALWAYS USE TANSTACK ROUTER FEATURES OVER HANDLING THINGS IN THE COMPONENT
- Prefer using tanstack query for state management
- For Tanstack router pages in `routes/`, keep the page component within the same file

## For \*.tsx Files

- NEVER EVER `import React from 'react'`. IT IS NOT NEEDED

## For React Copmonents

- Store components in src/components/(feature)/\*

## Check your work

- Use the `bun check-types` script to check your work and make sure no new type errors come up
