- translate the inferences to map coordinates
- make sure that rows in inferences have unique xyz model/ver
- grab user location instead of asking for coords
- also support a search box

- make the arrow in the popup go up or down depending on where it is?
- refine the map loading process. when should it jump to your location?
- add profile page
- tinder like thing that will help train the model

Write a doc about how the authentication and permissions work in this project. Make sure to note about stuff that will be needed to use this as well as refactor it in the future

I want you to put the training page And relevant endpoints behind a new permission that users must have in order to view and the write to to training data

update the document to detail that the permissions Strings are all stored in the constants file and All permissions should follow the same convention. After that update the files that you Just modified to follow this convention

- have a tiles currency that gives you the ability to scan tiles
- you can get more tiles by training lmao
